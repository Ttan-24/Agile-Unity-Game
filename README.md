#Day 2 of quarantine, supplys running low and i feel my body shutting down. Toilet paper ran out 2 hours ago... my arse is course. Im losing hope and i fear my life will end soon. If anyone finds this tell my wife i love them. Tanvi's laptop has broken into my bathroom and stole all my toilet paper. I've been forced to use my dog as a replacement.
